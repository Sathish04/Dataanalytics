2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
     When applying an operation to two vectors that requires them to be the same length, R automatically recycles, or repeats, the shorter one, until it is long enough to match the longer one.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.     
  > c(1,2,4) + c(6,0,9,20,22)
[1]  7  2 13 21 24
Warning message:
longer object length
  is not a multiple of shorter object length in: c(1, 2, 4) + c(6,  0, 9, 20, 22)
